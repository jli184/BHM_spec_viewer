# BHM_spec_viewer
Spectral visualization tool for SDSSV-BHM

---
This is a demo for a multi-epoch spectral viewer for SDSSV-BHM using plotly/dash (https://dash.plotly.com/). 
The ultimate goal is to build a web application that allows quick spectral visualization for SDSSV BHM data. 

---
Here is a list of functions that people have suggested in the collaboration:
  - include previous spectra from SDSS I-IV, provide downloadable links to all data
  - quick links to other database (Simbad, Ned, etc...)
  - accessibility to Utah server (will need help from the SDSS IT team)
  - renormalization of spectra (based on certain wavelength or line)
  - smoothing of spectra 
  - search with RA/Dec for objects
  - second figure to show the residual spectra in grey scale
